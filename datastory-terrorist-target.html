								<p><span style="font-size:24px">T</span>errorism is not too far from us. From the recent news, there are more big cities recently attacked by terrorists such as <a href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-terror-attack">Manchester</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2017_London_Bridge_attack">London</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/01/french-police-operation-under-way-at-marseille-train-station">Paris</a> and some more. It is not only political or military concerns anymore. Ordinary people like us ought to know a bit more about terrorism and the situation around the world, where the risky places usually targeted are and, most importantly, be able to avoid those places to reduce the risk of the harm from terrorism. </p>

It caused the death in thousands of people in United State and consequently led to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror">War of Terror</a> in the Middle-East region which mainly targeted to Iraq and Afghanistan. This incident was marked as the evolution of world terrorism. The World’s Terrorist Attack Map shows the terrorism-related attacks around the world starting from the 9/11 incident (11/09/2001), until now (2016).</p>

                                </blockquote>

								<p>The world’s terrorism situation is getting more terrible every year as can be seen in the steep uptrend in the Trend of Terrorist Attacks chart. The increase rate is so startling which went up by 30 times, from just a few hundred in 2001 to more than 15,000 attacks in recent years. With no doubt, the most dangerous region presented as red zone in the map are Middle East and North Africa and South Asia which are where the War of Terror took place. Iraq and Afghanistan were greatly affected by the 9/11 incident. They became<span style="color:red">**</span> the top three of most-attacked countries together with Pakistan. </p>
								<p style="font-size:smaller;color:red">**Note that before the 9/11 attacks, most terrorist attacks were from South America region with Colombia and Peru as the top-most-attacked countries. You can explore it yourself by changing the date filter in the map.</p>
								<p>It seems like, not only the red zone that has surprising increase in terrorist attacks, the European region which is a gather of powerful countries and contain a range of world popular destinations is also in that risk. There should be questions rising into your mind, right now, “Is your place or your destination still safe from terrorism?”, “What kind of target is often attacked?” and “How can we avoid that?”. Next visualisation is to show you that insights.

                                <h3 class="entry-title">What kind of target is commonly attacked?</h3>
								<p>This visualisation brings the top-6 most-targeted countries in Europe into spot. First of all, before going deeply into specific places, a little clue about cities in terrorist choices would be useful to bear in mind that what kind of city should be avoided. The bubble chart shows the relationship between the city size, indicated by its population, and the number of terrorist attacks. The bigger bubble means more attacks while the intensity of the blue colour represents higher population
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>The larger the city, the riskier it is..</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>Interestingly, most of the big cities, dark blue, were in the top list of terrorist attacks in each country. Especially, in Greece, France and Spain, the highest attack number took place on their largest cities, Athen, Paris and Madrid, respectively. While, in Ukraine, Russia and United Kingdom, the largest cities are still in the top-3 riskiest city. Taking all of these statistics into account, we can roughly presume that the larger the city, the riskier.
								</p>
                                <br />
								<h3 class="entry-title">How about target type? What kind of places should we avoid?</h3>
								<p>First thing that comes up to our mind about terrorism is conflicts between terrorist and governments. Does it mean we should avoid the government-related places?</p>
								<p>Let’s look at the figures in Target type table on the left. Astonishingly, government-related place is not the first top target as expected, instead, it is private property coming along with government and business area in 2nd and 3rd rank respectively. Looking at the different of top target types between large and small cities, business area becomes the first rank of terrorist target in large cities such as Paris, Madrid and Athens. While government-related targets are most often attacked in the smaller cities such as Slovyansk in Ukraine, Nazran in Russia, or San Sebastian in Spain. The difference in top target types between large and small cities is telling us something.</p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>Government-related areas are risky but business area is riskier when it comes for large city..</p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>With regard to <a href="http://courses.kvasaheim.com/hist319a/docs/Crenshaw%201981.PDF">The Cause of Terrorism</a> suggested by professor Martha Crenshaw, at Stanford, there are Long-run and Short-run strategies used in terrorism. Long-run means they aim to political changes and occupying government, while Short-run aim is the intention to advertising their needs to the world. Linking the theory with the statistics, terrorist’s main aim of attacking big cities is to advertise their existence to the world.</p> 
                                <p>This is why the area that potentially creates large impact such as business area comes as the first choice. On the other hand, in smaller cities, the attacks were more direct to the government-related target in accordance with Long-run strategy which is focusing on revolution.</p>
								<p>We have learnt some key factors from the data. The main question is “How can we avoid the terrorism?” </p>
                                <p>The best answer is to be away from those risky places. However, some of you might be the local people or for travel-lover, it is a pity to lose a chance to visit those beautiful cities such as Paris, Athens and Madrid. We cannot stop you from traveling but there are 2 taking-out messages from this data story that we hope you to bear in mind.</p>
								<ol>
								  <li>Terrorists like to attack large city especially in the area where they can create large impact to send out their message to the world.</li>
								  <li>Government-related areas are risky but business area is riskier when it comes for large city.</li>
								</ol> 
                                <br />
